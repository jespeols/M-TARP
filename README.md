## Multimodal Transformer for Antibiotic Resistance Prediction

This repository contains code for pretraining and finetuning the proposed multimodal fusion transformer model proposed in the Master's thesis project [*Predicting antibiotic resistance using fusion transformers*](https://odr.chalmers.se/items/60b86e99-37e3-4d2e-b658-92c8b25fb95a) by Jesper Olsson.  
The model uses multimodal, i.e. genotype and phenotype data, as well as available metadata such as date, country, and patient information, to predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes.
